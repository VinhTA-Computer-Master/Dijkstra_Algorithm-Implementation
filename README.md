A Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm developed by C++.

Program: Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm


This C code program is to be compiled and run using the provided makefile from zip file. This program uses C++ 11 language and the libraries specified in each file to compile. As required by project assignment and consulted from test cases, this program takes user inputs as commands to drive the program itself. Valid user inputs are:

     "E"
     "I"
     "W"
     "C <number> <number> <number>"

 * Note that the letter commands are NOT case sensitive. <number> should be replaced by number(s). There should be spaces between letter command and number(s), this program only takes 1 input for each command and will not work if letter commands and numbers are entered each time! Again, this is consulted from program specification of the assignment.

 * Program is designated to the listed valid user inputs only, any other inputs will not guarantee program's behavior as expected, ALTHOUGH it is guarded at most effort to take care of invalid inputs.

THANK YOU!
